# About me

Hi! I’m **Sharon Hon**, a third year undergraduate student reading Physics at the University of Oxford. I am currently interning at Westlake University, China, studying fine-grained epidemiology with the aid of network theory. 

Outside of academics, I enjoy painting, learning the guitar and reading. I also enjoy playing squash and table tennis.
